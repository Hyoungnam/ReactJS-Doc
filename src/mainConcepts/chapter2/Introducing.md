### Why JSX?
### Embedding Expressions in JSX
### You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX
### JSX is an Expression Too
### Specifying Attributes with JSX
```
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```
```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
It is safe to embed user input in JSX:
```
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```
By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

### Warning: class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.
